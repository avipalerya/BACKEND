1.Explain IActionResult
-->The IActionResult return type is appropriate when multiple ActionResult return types are possible in an action. The ActionResult types represent various HTTP status codes. Any non-abstract class deriving from ActionResult qualifies as a valid return type.
 Some common return types in this category are BadRequestResult (400), NotFoundResult (404), and OkObjectResult (200). 
Alternatively, convenience methods in the ControllerBase class can be used to return ActionResult types from an action. For example, return BadRequest(); is a shorthand form of return new BadRequestResult();.
Because there are multiple return types and paths in this type of action, liberal use of the [ProducesResponseType] attribute is necessary. 
This attribute produces more descriptive response details for web API help pages generated by tools like Swagger. [ProducesResponseType] indicates the known types and HTTP status codes to be returned by the action.
