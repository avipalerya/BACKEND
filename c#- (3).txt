2. what happens while converting string to int when we have String data with Number?
==>
String could be converted to integers too but only when there are numbers in the strings. When it is not convertible, there be an error raised.
It is a ValueError because all these int, str, floats are values and when it is not compatible, there is an error.

3. Is there any ways to convert the alfa numerical value into int? 
==>
In C#, you can convert a string representation of a number to an integer using the following ways:

Parse() method
Convert class
TryParse() method 

4. What is the diff b/w parse() and TryParse()?
==>
Parse throws an exception if it cannot parse the value, whereas TryParse returns a bool indicating whether it succeeded.

TryParse does not just try/catch internally - the whole point of it is that it is implemented without exceptions so that it is fast.
In fact the way it is most likely implemented is that internally the Parse method will call TryParse and then throw an exception if it returns false.

5. Why cant we implicitly convert char to string? 

public void question2()
        {
            int i = 15;
            for(; ; )
            {
                Console.WriteLine("{0}",i);

                if(i>= -5)
                {
                    i -= -5;
                }
                else
                {
                    break ;
                }
            }
        }
